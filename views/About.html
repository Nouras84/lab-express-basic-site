    <h2>Kurosawa Akira</h2>
    <p>
      March 23, 1910 â€“ September 6, 1998 was a Japanese filmmaker and painter
      who directed 30 films in a career spanning over five decades. He is widely
      regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the
      history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly
      influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with
      all aspects of film production. Kurosawa entered the Japanese film
      industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of
      working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he
      made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action
      film Sanshiro Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed
      Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor
      Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as
      one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go
      on to collaborate on another fifteen films.
